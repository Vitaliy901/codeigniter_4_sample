# CodeIgniter 4 Application Sample


## API Documentation

We should carefully support our API documentation, each controller action that mapped to the route should be documented.
Use syntax described for following library https://zircote.github.io/swagger-php/ and be ready that your pull request
will not be accepted if something wrong with documentation.

Documentation available at http://localhost/api/documentation

Also, do not forget to update postman_collection.json if you do some changes in API
